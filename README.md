# hello-world
My first github repository

Hey there, my name's Gustavo

I finished university with a major in mathematics, but I wanted to try 
my hand at programming to see what I can do. I did take a few courses in
C so I'm not completely unfamiliar with programming. Still, there's a lot
for me to learn. Any useful tips, advice and comments will always be 
appreciated.
